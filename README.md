# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 2 - Personal Portfolio

## Description

1. In this challenge, my main goal was to create a personal portfolio with working navigation, flexboxes and practiced responsive web design.

2. I decided to go further and flush out the CSS and design of the site to help further my career development, and showcase my abilities as a web developer.

3. Throughout the process, I learned a lot about flexboxes,and helped solidify my knowledge of variables, padding, margins, and other basic CSS concepts. Ihis project also helped me develop an internal process for researching concepts for things I want to do and subsequentally how to turn those ideas into HTML and CSS code.

## Installation and Usage

The source code is available for download, so if you want to check it out for yourself on a local machine, it is as simple as downloading the .zip file from GitHub, extracting it, and taking a peak! The HTML can be opened in any file viewer of your choice and the CSS can be opened in any text file editor of your choice.

## Mockup:
